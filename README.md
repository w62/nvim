# My neovim configuration

Everything should be sitting in $HOME/.config/ 
neovim 0.6 or later is required.

It is based on [Christian Chiarulli's](https://twitter.com/chrisatmachine) [Neovim from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ)

Initially I am setting up my neovim for learning Rust. But as I moved on, I am picking up some sorts of lua as well. Then moving on to writing with neovim.

This is the configuration that I am using - that I am polishing now.
